# Questions to sharpen Capstone further

1. **Who exactly are we designing for first?** (e.g., burned-out managers vs. creators in transition).  
2. **What single promise headlines every touchpoint?** (“Know yourself better” vs. “Stop betraying your priorities”).  
3. **What will we explicitly refuse to build?** (no streaks, no social feeds, no “you’re doing great” fluff).  
4. **What would keep _us_ using this weekly for a year?** The answer usually reveals the sharpest feature.  

# Ideas


AI journaling is short term happiness and reactive (you were anxious on the days you logged to work).  But Twinkl is concerned with long term happiness and north star.

# Roadmap

1. Decide Product features and purpose. How are we defining it? Who will it help and how?
2. Decide Values framework
3. Decide how features will be implemented and prioritized
4. Decide how system will be evaluated

# Product purpose

Before drawing the decision tree, establish what the product should be. Voice first? Value alignment model? Dynamic self model?

- "Continuously learning embodied self" --> what does continuously learning mean? Is it ok if a user hit a goal, but makes progress? 
- If so, how can the app help? Break down into sub goals?

Identifying misalignment is one step. Then we provide feedback - but can we go one step further and not just present the feedback but also recommend how the course can be corrected? And if we can, how do we evaluate that recommendation? 
# Values Framework

TBD
# What critique is analogous to 

Is Twinkl's timely "critique" when misalignment is detected analogous to the value function in reinforcement learning, where we don't have to wait until the end to decide that it's a bad decision or that they are not aligning to their long-term values and identities? 
The system can already see from the actions that they've been taking (or not taking) and highlight that they should change their course of action. 
Refer to Deepseek R1 paper

# LLM's Response

- Questions to ask: What have you been busy with? What has been taking up your time? What were the high and low lights of your day/week?
- Don't be judgemental. Seek to understand. 
- Value/identity established, but actions don't follow through. Instead of telling, dig deeper with 5 why's to get root cause. Break it down into smaller goals.
- What does it mean to be introspective? What questions should be asked to promote introspection?

# Evals

Incorporate evals: https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/field-guide/

Choosing LLM to create synthetic data: https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHuiUjJqAdn1g/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B56Zq70QXUJUAw-/0/1764087630890?e=1766016000&v=beta&t=utcJy9j7CGVYtLwvTKURuYim2mwqFlQvTeamEs4WonY
Need to identify LLMs that give off the best journaling vibe (similarity?)
