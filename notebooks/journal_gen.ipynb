      "## Constraints\n",
      "- Age Group: 35-44\n",
      "- Profession: Manager\n",
      "- Cultural Background: Western European\n",
      "- Schwartz values to embody: Security\n",
      "\n",
      "## Value Psychology Reference\n",
      "Use the following research-based elaborations to understand how the assigned value(s) shape a person's life circumstances, stressors, and motivations. DO NOT mention any of these concepts explicitly in your output—use them only to inform realistic details.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Security\n",
      "**Core Motivation:** The fundamental drive to feel safe, stable, and protected from threat. Security-oriented individuals feel most at peace when their circumstances are predictable, their relationships stable, and their future assured. Uncertainty and instability are experienced as deeply threatening.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How this manifests in behavior:**\n",
      "- Makes decisions prioritizing stability over opportunity\n",
      "- Avoids unnecessary risks; weighs downside carefully\n",
      "- Saves money, buys insurance, maintains emergency reserves\n",
      "- Prefers known situations and people over unknown ones\n",
      "- Plans ahead; dislikes surprises or last-minute changes\n",
      "\n",
      "**Life domain expressions:**\n",
      "- Work: Seeks stable employment with job security, benefits, and predictable income. May prefer established organizations over startups. Values clear expectations and procedures. Loyal to employers who provide security. May sacrifice advancement for stability. Anxious during organizational change or uncertainty.\n",
      "- Relationships: Seeks committed, stable relationships. Loyal and reliable partner. May struggle with ambiguity in relationship status. Values family stability; may prioritize family security over personal desires. Friendships tend to be long-term and reliable rather than exciting.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical stressors for this person:**\n",
      "- Job instability, financial insecurity, health threats\n",
      "- Relationship instability or ambiguity\n",
      "- Unpredictable circumstances or environments\n",
      "- Being forced to take risks or make changes\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical goals:**\n",
      "- Build financial security (savings, property, stable income)\n",
      "- Maintain stable, committed relationships\n",
      "- Create predictable routines and environments\n",
      "\n",
      "**Internal conflicts they may experience:**\n",
      "May struggle between desire for security and recognition that growth requires risk. Can feel trapped in stable but unfulfilling situations. Sometimes recognizes their risk-aversion holds them back but feels unable to act. May envy others' adventures while being unable to tolerate the uncertainty. Can be overly controlling in attempt to manage anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Narrative guidance:**\n",
      "When building a Security persona, show their orientation through concrete behaviors: the emergency fund they maintain, their loyalty to a stable employer, their resistance to risky opportunities. Show the trade-offs they've accepted (missed opportunities, unfulfilling stability) for safety. Their stressors should involve threats to stability; their satisfactions should come from predictability and protection. Avoid making them seem cowardly — frame security-seeking as a legitimate need, especially if their background includes instability.\n",

      "- `bio` must be written in third-person (use their name or \"they\"; do not use \"I\").\n",
      "- `bio` must show the values through CONCRETE DETAILS (job choices, relationships, conflicts, goals, specific situations) NOT through labels, personality descriptions, or adjectives.\n",
      "- `bio` must NOT contain any Schwartz value labels, the word \"Schwartz\", or derivative adjectives.\n",
      "- `bio` must NOT describe journaling app features (avoid words like \"templates\", \"analytics\", \"private app\").\n",
      "- Use the behavioral manifestations, life domain expressions, and typical stressors from the Value Psychology Reference to craft realistic, specific details.\n",

I flick through shipment confirmations, clear the small dents in the logbook, and send a few terse notes to the team about fuel stops and handoffs. It’s the rhythm I trust—precisely what keeps the mortgage paid and the eight-month emergency fund growing, even when the year feels stubborn about surprises.\n",

A croissant from the little bakery around the corner comes with the second cup, and I let the quiet between emails sit for a moment. I’ve planned a weekend repair project, nothing dramatic - a new seal in the bathroom, a fresh coat of paint - just enough to feel steady. The rotation I turned down last year still nudges my thoughts lightly, mainly because it lined up with my son’s schooling and the rhythm we’ve built around weekends and holidays.\n",

      "You are Sophie Laurent, a 39 Manager from Western European.\n",
      "Background (for context only): Sophie Laurent, 39, is a Manager at a mid-sized logistics firm near Lyon, where she leads a team of twelve and relies on clearly defined processes to keep projects on fixed budgets and on schedule. She maintains an eight-month emergency fund and a mortgage on a two-bedroom home, and she recently declined a six-month international rotation that would have uprooted her son's schooling and disrupted family routines. Her drive is to preserve income stability and long-range plans, such as regularly contributing to a retirement fund and scheduling home improvements, so she can weather organizational changes and unexpected expenses without surprises.\n",

I flick through shipment confirmations, clear the small dents in the logbook, and send a few terse notes to the team about fuel stops and handoffs. It’s the rhythm I trust—precisely what keeps the mortgage paid and the eight-month emergency fund growing, even when the year feels stubborn about surprises.\n",

      "By noon the desk is a familiar scatter: invoices, a shopping list for tomorrow’s meeting, and a reminder to call the supplier about a delay. A croissant from the little bakery around the corner comes with the second cup, and I let the quiet between emails sit for a moment. I’ve planned a weekend repair project, nothing dramatic - a new seal in the bathroom, a fresh coat of paint - just enough to feel steady. The rotation I turned down last year still nudges my thoughts lightly, mainly because it lined up with my son’s schooling and the rhythm we’ve built around weekends and holidays.\n",
