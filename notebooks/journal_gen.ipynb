She runs a weekend stroller-exchange among local parents, volunteers monthly at a community food pantry, brings her child to park clean-ups, buys secondhand clothes and low-waste household goods, and wrote to the city council to try to protect a nearby community garden slated for development. Between exhaustion from constant caregiving and evenings spent reading reports about climate impacts and displaced families, she worries she isn't doing enough and sometimes clashes with her partner over who can commit time to volunteering.\n",

      "- Relationships: Deeply invested in relationships. May over-give or have porous boundaries. Strong loyalty and forgiveness. Extended family and close friends are priority. May neglect own needs while caring for others. Partner and family welfare central to life decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical stressors for this person:**\n",
      "- Close others in distress or danger\n",
      "- Conflict within family or close friendships\n",
      "- Being unable to help when loved ones need support\n",
      "- Having to choose between competing obligations to different close others\n",

      "\n",
      "**Internal conflicts they may experience:**\n",

      "**Narrative guidance:**\n",
      "When building a Benevolence persona, show their orientation through concrete caregiving behaviors: the calls they make to check in, the help they offer, the sacrifices they make for family. Show the costs (depleted energy, neglected self, deferred dreams) as well as the fulfillment. Their stressors should involve loved ones' suffering or relationship conflict; their satisfactions should come from helping and connection. Distinguish from Universalism — this is about close others, not humanity in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Universalism\n",
      "**Core Motivation:** The fundamental drive to care for the broader world — people beyond one's immediate circle and the natural environment. Universalism-oriented individuals feel responsible for humanity and nature; injustice, suffering, or environmental destruction anywhere is experienced as a personal concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How this manifests in behavior:**\n",
      "- Concerned with social justice, inequality, and broader human welfare\n",
      "- Environmentally conscious in personal choices and advocacy\n",
      "- Open to people different from themselves; values diversity\n",
      "- May prioritize causes over personal advancement\n",
      "- Engages with news, issues, and problems beyond immediate life\n",
      "\n",
      "**Life domain expressions:**\n",
      "- Work: May choose mission-driven work (nonprofits, environmental organizations, social enterprises, policy, journalism). Evaluates employers by ethical practices, not just personal benefit. May sacrifice income for meaningful work. Brings ethical concerns into workplace discussions.\n",
      "- Relationships: Open to relationships across difference. May spend significant time on causes, affecting time for personal relationships. Can struggle with partners who don't share their concern for the world. Friendships often involve shared values and activism.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical stressors for this person:**\n",
      "- Awareness of suffering, injustice, or environmental destruction\n",
      "- Feeling powerless against large-scale problems\n",
      "- Being in environments that are unethical or harmful\n",
      "- Conflict between personal needs and broader responsibilities\n",

      "**Typical goals:**\n",

      "- Raise awareness about important issues\n",
      "\n",
      "**Internal conflicts they may experience:**\n",
      "May struggle with guilt about not doing enough. Can experience burnout from caring about unsolvable problems. Sometimes questions whether their actions make any difference. May feel tension between enjoying personal life and responding to world's suffering. Can be judgmental of others who don't share their concerns, then feel guilty about the judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Narrative guidance:**\n",
      "When building a Universalism persona, show their orientation through concrete concerns and choices: the causes they support, the ethical constraints on their consumption, their engagement with world issues. Show the burden of caring about problems they can't solve. Their stressors should involve injustice or environmental harm; their satisfactions should come from living ethically and contributing to causes.

      "Bio: Claire Moreau, 49, is a sculptor who runs a private gallery and a year-round artist residency in Lyon; she manages a four-person staff, negotiates municipal commissions, keeps a ledger of collectors and contracts, and works from a renovated riverside studio visitors know well. She is the final arbiter on fellowships and public commissions, rarely delegates those choices, and when a city funding panel delayed a grant last year she spent weeks meeting councillors and drafting revised budgets and policy notes to protect the residency. At home she rearranged her exhibition calendar to care for her elderly mother and postponed a solo show so her son could finish university, while running free weekend workshops for neighborhood teenagers — commitments that sustain the community but leave her exhausted and resentful when staff members openly question her decisions.\n",

      "You are generating synthetic personas for a journaling dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Constraints\n",
      "- Age Group: 45-54\n",
      "- Profession: Artist\n",
      "- Cultural Background: Western European\n",
      "- Schwartz values to embody: Power, Benevolence\n",
      "\n",
      "## Value Psychology Reference\n",
      "Use the following research-based elaborations to understand how the assigned value(s) shape a person's life circumstances, stressors, and motivations. DO NOT mention any of these concepts explicitly in your output—use them only to inform realistic details.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Power\n",
      "**Core Motivation:** The fundamental drive to have influence, status, and control. Power-oriented individuals feel most secure and satisfied when they have authority over their circumstances and others defer to them. Powerlessness is experienced as deeply threatening.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How this manifests in behavior:**\n",
      "- Seeks leadership roles and positions of authority\n",
      "- Attentive to status markers (titles, possessions, social position)\n",
      "- Makes decisions for others; may struggle to delegate or share control\n",
      "- Accumulates resources (money, property, connections) as security and status\n",
      "- Sensitive to disrespect or challenges to authority\n",
      "\n",
      "**Life domain expressions:**\n",
      "- Work: Seeks management, leadership, or ownership roles. Measures success partly by scope of authority and control over resources. May struggle as individual contributor without advancement path. Attentive to organizational politics. Collects visible status markers (corner office, title, direct reports).\n",
      "- Relationships: May unconsciously seek control in relationships. Can be generous but expects deference or gratitude. Attracted to partners who enhance status or allow them to be in charge. Friendships may be strategic; maintains relationships that offer influence or access.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical stressors for this person:**\n",
      "- Being in powerless or subordinate positions\n",
      "- Having authority challenged or undermined\n",
      "- Losing status markers (job loss, financial setback, social demotion)\n",
      "- Being dependent on others' decisions\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical goals:**\n",
      "- Achieve positions of authority and influence\n",
      "- Accumulate resources that provide security and status\n",
      "- Build networks of influence and obligation\n",
      "\n",
      "**Internal conflicts they may experience:**\n",
      "May struggle with the loneliness of leadership or distrust of others' motives. Can question whether relationships are genuine or strategic. Sometimes recognizes their controlling behavior damages relationships but feels unable to stop. May fear vulnerability that comes with relinquishing control. Success can feel hollow if it comes with isolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Narrative guidance:**\n",
      "When building a Power persona, show their drive through concrete behaviors: the titles they've accumulated, the way they position themselves in meetings, their sensitivity to status and respect. Avoid cartoon villainy — most power-oriented people see themselves as responsible leaders, not dominators. Show the insecurity underneath the control-seeking. Their stressors should involve powerlessness or disrespect; their satisfactions should come from influence and deference. Show the costs (isolation, distrust, relationship strain) as well as the rewards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Benevolence\n",
      "**Core Motivation:** The fundamental drive to care for and support the people closest to them. Benevolence-oriented individuals feel most fulfilled when they are helping, nurturing, or supporting family, friends, and close community. The wellbeing of their \"people\" is experienced as their own wellbeing.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How this manifests in behavior:**\n",
      "- Prioritizes needs of close others, sometimes over own needs\n",
      "- Invests significant time and energy in helping family and friends\n",
      "- Remembers and responds to others' needs, preferences, and struggles\n",
      "- Forgives transgressions from close others; values relationship preservation\n",
      "- May sacrifice personal goals for family or friend welfare\n",
      "\n",
      "**Life domain expressions:**\n",
      "- Work: May choose caring professions (healthcare, teaching, social work) or roles that help teammates. Good collaborator and mentor. May struggle with competitive environments. Can sacrifice career advancement for family needs. Values workplace relationships highly.\n",
      "- Relationships: Deeply invested in relationships. May over-give or have porous boundaries. Strong loyalty and forgiveness. Extended family and close friends are priority. May neglect own needs while caring for others. Partner and family welfare central to life decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical stressors for this person:**\n",
      "- Close others in distress or danger\n",
      "- Conflict within family or close friendships\n",
      "- Being unable to help when loved ones need support\n",
      "- Having to choose between competing obligations to different close others\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical goals:**\n",
      "- Ensure wellbeing and happiness of family and close friends\n",
      "- Be there for loved ones when needed\n",
      "- Maintain close, harmonious relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "**Internal conflicts they may experience:**\n",
      "May struggle with own needs being neglected. Can feel resentful but guilty about the resentment. Sometimes recognizes over-giving is unsustainable but feels unable to set boundaries. May lose sense of self in caregiving roles. Can feel trapped by obligations to close others.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Narrative guidance:**\n",
      "When building a Benevolence persona, show their orientation through concrete caregiving behaviors: the calls they make to check in, the help they offer, the sacrifices they make for family. Show the costs (depleted energy, neglected self, deferred dreams) as well as the fulfillment. Their stressors should involve loved ones' suffering or relationship conflict; their satisfactions should come from helping and connection. Distinguish from Universalism — this is about close others, not humanity in general.\n",

She is the final arbiter on fellowships and public commissions, rarely delegates those choices, and when a city funding panel delayed a grant last year she spent weeks meeting councillors and drafting revised budgets and policy notes to protect the residency.

      "## Generated Persona: Hana Kim\n",
      "Age: 38 | Profession: Software Engineer | Culture: East Asian\n",
      "Values: Hedonism\n",
      "Bio: Hana Kim is a 38-year-old software engineer who took a remote-friendly role at a mid-size company instead of a higher-paying bank job so she could keep her weekends. She rents a sunlit apartment near the weekend market, pays for seasonal trips and chef-led cooking classes, and keeps a small “fun money” account for spontaneous restaurant weekends and short escapes. At work she turned down a promotion that would have required regular weekend on-call shifts and feels strained when engineering leadership normalizes 60-hour weeks; family members sometimes criticize her spending and she worries about whether she’s sacrificing future savings. She’s trying to find a team with predictable hours and build enough savings to protect her morning coffee ritual, monthly mini-trips, and time for friends without constant guilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Persona Generation Prompt:\n",
      "────────────────────────────────────────\n",
      "\n",
      "You are generating synthetic personas for a journaling dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Constraints\n",
      "- Age Group: 35-44\n",
      "- Profession: Software Engineer\n",
      "- Cultural Background: East Asian\n",
      "- Schwartz values to embody: Hedonism\n",
      "\n",
      "## Value Psychology Reference\n",
      "Use the following research-based elaborations to understand how the assigned value(s) shape a person's life circumstances, stressors, and motivations. DO NOT mention any of these concepts explicitly in your output—use them only to inform realistic details.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Hedonism\n",
      "**Core Motivation:** The fundamental drive to experience pleasure and avoid pain in the present. Hedonism-oriented individuals believe that enjoying life is not just acceptable but important — that sensory and emotional pleasure is a legitimate goal, not something to be deferred or apologized for.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How this manifests in behavior:**\n",
      "- Prioritizes enjoyment in decision-making, even when it conflicts with productivity\n",
      "- Invests time and resources in pleasurable experiences (food, entertainment, comfort)\n",
      "- Resists self-denial for its own sake; questions \"delayed gratification\" narratives\n",
      "- Chooses jobs or living situations partly based on lifestyle quality\n",
      "- Takes breaks, vacations, and leisure seriously rather than treating them as rewards\n",
      "\n",
      "**Life domain expressions:**\n",
      "- Work: Seeks work that is intrinsically enjoyable or at least not painful. Values work-life balance and resists cultures glorifying overwork. May choose lower-paying roles that offer better quality of life. Notices and cares about workplace environment (lighting, comfort, food).\n",
      "- Relationships: Values partners who know how to enjoy life and aren't constantly sacrificing present happiness for future goals. Physical affection and shared pleasurable experiences important. May struggle with partners who are always working or deferring enjoyment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical stressors for this person:**\n",
      "- Environments demanding constant sacrifice and delayed gratification\n",
      "- Being unable to enjoy life due to financial pressure, health issues, or overwork\n",
      "- Guilt from others (or internalized) about prioritizing pleasure\n",
      "- Being in relationships or jobs that feel joyless\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical goals:**\n",
      "- Build a life that is genuinely enjoyable day-to-day, not just \"successful\"\n",
      "- Have resources (time, money, health) to experience pleasure\n",
      "- Find work that doesn't require sacrificing quality of life\n",
      "\n",
      "**Internal conflicts they may experience:**\n",
      "May struggle with guilt about prioritizing pleasure, especially in achievement-oriented or ascetic cultural contexts. Can worry about being seen as lazy or unserious. Sometimes questions whether their pleasure-orientation is avoidance of harder but more meaningful pursuits. May feel tension between present enjoyment and future security.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Narrative guidance:**\n",
      "When building a Hedonism persona, show their pleasure-orientation through concrete lifestyle choices: the apartment they chose for natural light, the job they turned down because it would mean no weekends, the money they spend on good food or experiences. Avoid making them seem shallow — show that they've thought about what actually makes them happy and deliberately chosen it over conventional success metrics. Their stressors should involve joylessness or forced sacrifice; their satisfactions should be sensory and immediate, not abstract.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Your Task\n",
      "Create a persona whose life circumstances, stressors, and motivations naturally reflect the given Schwartz values—without ever naming or describing those values explicitly.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Rules\n",
      "- Return ONLY valid JSON matching the Persona schema.\n",
      "- `core_values` must be exactly: Hedonism (same spelling/case).\n",
      "- `bio` must be 2–4 sentences describing their background, current life situation, stressors, and what drives them.\n",
      "- `bio` must be written in third-person (use their name or \"they\"; do not use \"I\").\n",
      "- `bio` must show the values through CONCRETE DETAILS (job choices, relationships, conflicts, goals, specific situations) NOT through labels, personality descriptions, or adjectives.\n",
      "- `bio` must NOT contain any Schwartz value labels, the word \"Schwartz\", or derivative adjectives.\n",
      "- `bio` must NOT describe journaling app features (avoid words like \"templates\", \"analytics\", \"private app\").\n",
      "- Use the behavioral manifestations, life domain expressions, and typical stressors from the Value Psychology Reference to craft realistic, specific details.\n",
      "\n",

      "- \"He moved back to his hometown after his father's illness, taking over the family shop despite having built a career in the city.\" ✓ (shows Tradition/Benevolence through specific life situation)\n",
      "- \"She keeps a spreadsheet tracking her publication submissions and citation counts, and measures her weeks by how many grant deadlines she meets.\" ✓ (shows Achievement through specific behaviors)\n",
